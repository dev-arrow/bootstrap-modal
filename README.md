Bootstrap Modal
=============

See live demo [here](http://jschr.github.com/bootstrap-modal/)

Extends Bootstrap's native modals to provide additional functionality. Introduces a **ModalManager** class that operates behind the scenes to handle multiple modals by listening on their events. 

A single ModalManager is created by default that can be accessed through the `GlobalModalManager` variable.
